**The Global Information**
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This graphs at the start of the the report,																	   |
shows the reponse time and number of requests in the 1 minute load test that we have preformed.				   |
We can see that all the requests from the simulation were serviced(OK) and preformed in a good response time,  |
all under 800ms reponse time.																				   |
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Active Users along the Simulation**
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This graph shows, the number of users during the simulation.												   |
We used a rampUsersPerSec function in the simulation, from 45 users at once to 50 in a duration of 1 minute.   |
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Response time distribution**
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This graph shows, the distribution of the reponse time.														   |
We can see that the precentage of requests that were served in a 2ms reponse time was 100%					   |
that's because the app is not complicated at all, and the requests were not demanding.						   |
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Response Time Precntiles over Time**
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
At the start of the simulation the reponse time was a bit high than the rest of the duration				   |
of the simulation, that's because the app was logged by 45 users at once, and then ramped up				   |
to 50 through the simulation, so the response time went down.												   |
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Number of requests per second**
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This graph shows the number of requests at given time through the duration									   |
of the simulation, and how many users were Active.															   |
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Number of responses per second**
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This graph shows the reposne of the requests and the active users.											   |
